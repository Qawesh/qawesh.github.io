        <img src="./images/design1.jpg" alt="My original design"
        <p>Once my group and I had completed our project's design requirements, we began working on concepts for the product itself. The image above was my main concept drawing for how I thought it should be. We had all agreed on the general layout of the cyberdeck, particularly on it being a case that opens up into a screen and a keyboard. I had the screen in the top half and the keyboard on the bottom half after opening. Most of the electronics would be in the top half, as the screen would need more circuitry than the keyboard would. The circuits would be just underneath the screen, with the battery below it. The bottom half wouldn't have too much, just a keyboard and a spare battery beneath it. The plan would be to make both the screen + circuits and the keyboard removable so the batteries could be swapped. Obviously this was just an early design.</p>
