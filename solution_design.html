        <h2>Part 1: Concept Development</h2>
        <img src="./images/design1.jpg" alt="My original design"
        <p>Once my group and I had completed our project's design requirements, we began working on concepts for the product itself. The image above was my main concept drawing for how I thought it should be. We had all agreed on the general layout of the cyberdeck, particularly on it being a case that opens up into a screen and a keyboard. I had the screen in the top half and the keyboard on the bottom half after opening. Most of the electronics would be in the top half, as the screen would need more circuitry than the keyboard would. The circuits would be just underneath the screen, with the battery below it. The bottom half wouldn't have too much, just a keyboard and a spare battery beneath it. The plan would be to make both the screen + circuits and the keyboard removable so the batteries could be swapped. Obviously this was just an early design.</p>

        <p>After looking through all these values, the one with more total points was the smaller design, with 52 points, compared to the larger design's 51. The smaller design is more portable, cheaper, and more durable, while the larger design is easier to use, more customizable, and has a longer battery life and larger screen. As a result of this, we chose to develop the smaller design, as it better fits the goals of our project. This was a close competition, however, and they both have their merits, so we may choose to continue developing the larger one in the future.</p>
