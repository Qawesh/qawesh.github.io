        <th>Guard, U. C. (2024). Recreational Boating Statistics. US Department of Homeland Security: Washington DC, USA.</th>
        <th>(Note: focus on pages 18-32). This document is provided by the US Coast Guard. There are many reasons why fatal accidents happen on personal watercraft. Some examples of causes of fatal accidents are alcohol use, weather or hazardous waters, and innatention by the operator. However, the category with the greatest number of fatalities is 'Unknown', which means the cause of the accident is not known. In addition, when looking at when accidents happen, it is more likely that an accident at night is fatal than an accident during the day, with a mortality increase of about 5-10%. Finally, the majority of the deaths come from accidents involving smaller vessels, with 467 of a reported 564 fatalities being in a boat under 26 feet long.</th>
        <th>All of these data points show how our idea could help reduce boating related fatalities. A significant number of these fatalities have unknown causes, which shows that a lack of available communication to authorities may have exacerbated the accident and led to the deaths. In addition, many deaths from weather could be avoided if the captain had better knowledge of the upcoming environmental conditions. The greater fatality rate at night may be related to the greater difficulty in locating people who need to be rescued. Smaller vessels tend to have less robust communications systems, which would be more likely to go down in event of emergency, leaving people with no way to communicate the problem to rescuers, especially if the boat sinks. Our product can help solve this by providing a method for communication that is unattached to the boat and able to survive difficult conditions, provide a position so rescuers can find the location of the person, and provide weather information, including alerts if hazardous weather is approaching.</th>

        <th>This paper is written by 4 people working in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Kuwait. It demonstrates that boating accidents are a significant problem due to the amount of fatalities they cause, and that the operation of a personal watercraft is a likely to result in an accident as operating a car. Their solution to take inspiration from solutions used in the automotive industry, namely in crash prevention. Along with cars, crashing into objects is a major source of fatal accidents involving boats, but cars have had a major increase in crash prevention software to alert drivers if they are about to hit something. The authors propose a system that would both sense nearby objects with radar and detect if a crash has occured, which would also be able to connect with the Coast Guard.</th>
        <th>The paper by these authors shows both how important this issue is and the utility of our solution. First off, this paper is fromn Kuwait and was presented to a conference in Bahrain, which shows how widespread this problem is. Over there in the Middle East, the paper shows that there are still a significant number of boating fatalities to the point where it needs to be addressed. If groups from across the world belive this issue needs to be addressed, then in Florida, an area where boating is an important part of life, it must also be addressed. In addition, the proposed solution includes one of the components of our solution, namely the ability to communicate with the Coast Guard. A lack of reliable communication with rescuers is one of the big problems causing fatalities in boating accidents, and that better communication with the authorities is part of this solution implicitly validates that being part of ours.</th>

        <th>South Korea has had many major boating accidents in the past decade, most notably the Sewol Ferry Disaster, which led to the deaths of 304 people. Another incident involves a fishing boat which overturned, killing seven people, which is the focus of this paper. This boat faced heavy wind gusts while out fishing, which caused it to capsize, killing the crew. Computer modeling proved that it was possible that that kind of boat was flipped over as a result of the wind, which at shore was 20.7 meters per second. This analysis also confirmed that those winds extended to where the boat was on the ocean. The vessel's desmise was met unexpectedly, so the crew were unable to signal for help. The authors state that events like this need to be prevented in the future. </th>
        <th>This incident and the analysis around it confirms the need for our product to help the safety of boaters. This incident is one of many in South Korea, and although boats flipping is a comparatively small number compared to other accidents, it is still an important cause. The crew was uninformed about the upcoming danger of the wind, which is what ultimately led to their deaths. Our product could help in situations like these as it would provide up-to-date weather data, even in difficult conditions, which would provide a warning that the conditions would be too dangerous for boating and that that area should have been avoided. It also would have helped signal for distress. In this scenario, the crew were unable to signal an emergency because they couldn't reach the button for it, as it probably could not have been after it capsized. With our product, they still would have been able to signal after this point because they could still have it with them as it is portable.</th>

        <th>Gohrabi, M. M., Ghobakhloo, R. H., Aminizadeh, E. (2014). System and method for automatic distress at sea, US867453B2, US Patent Office</th>
        <th>This patent is a system to automatically send a message in event of emergency. This would work through the installation of a large amount of sensors on a ship controlled by a processor. Once these sensors detect an emergency, such as fire, flooding, or a collision, they trigger an alarm after a certain amount of time. Once the danger is confirmed by a human, it then automatically sends a message through satellite to the nearest maritime search and rescue center. This message would contain what emergency the ship was facing, where the ship is located, what time the emergency was, and the call sign of the ship. An Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon would be used to provide updates on the position and wheteher the ship has sunk. If the alarm is false, the message will not be sent to the authorities</th>
        <th>This patent shows the need for boat emergency systems. This system's purpose is to provide more rapid and automatic emergency responses when a ship is in distress so emergency responders can get there more quickly. It has a similar function to what we are developing, namely that a function is to provide an easier way to get in contact with emergency responders. However, ours has some advantages over this. Ours is portable, which means that the alarm can be triggered from anywhere on the ship, not just in a specific spot. This also allows for the alarm to be activated even if the ship goes down quickly, as with this patent that is not possible. However, with our method, the danger would ahve to be manually inputted, as the boat would not contain the sensors that give this design its quick analysis time. Its usage of the beacon is something that could be implemented into our design, so as to make it easier to find the boat after an incident.</th>

        <th>Katz, D. (2010). Location recording system, US7855654B2, US Patent Office</th>
        <th>This patent is meant to be for a system that can record the location of an object falling off a vessel, so it can be tracked and recovered. This system includes a short range wireless device, a radio beacon, and a remote control station. The beacon would be on the vessel, while the wireless device would be on the object that needs to be tracked. The device would emit signals that the becaon would use to determine how far away they are from each other. If the device passes more than a certain distance away from the beacon, then an alarm will be sounded to show that the object is now overboard. Then, the remote control station would use data from both the device and the beacon to determine the location of the object relative to the beacon. This would be to make overboard rescues easier and more successful.</th>
        <th>This system is very interesting, as it helps specificallly to deal with a particular emergency that may arise during maritime pursuits. It focuses on the quick recovery of those who have fallen overboard on a ship, which is a serious problem as if this occurs in difficult conditions then it is very difficult to rescue the person and they may die. This method of using device signals to track how far away objects are from each other is very smart, as it can still be used in inclement conditions and the alarm is a useful alert system. a similar thing could be implmented in our product, with our device serving as the center of the system, allowing us to see and recieve the data more easily and more quickly understand where the missing eprson is. It could also pair well with the system above, as it could be linked to signal emergency search and rescue in case the person is not found quickly or if they need medical assistance after being recovered.</th>
