        <th>(Note: focus on pages 18-32). There are many reasons why fatal accidents happen on personal watercraft. Some examples of causes of fatal accidents are alcohol use, weather or hazardous waters, and innatention by the operator. However, the category with the greatest number of fatalities is 'Unknown', which means the cause of the accident is not known. In addition, when looking at when accidents happen, it is more likely that an accident at night is fatal than an accident during the day, with a mortality increase of about 5-10%. Finally, the majority of the deaths come from accidents involving smaller vessels, with 467 of a reported 564 fatalities being in a boat under 26 feet long.</th>
        <th>All of these data points show how our idea could help reduce boating related fatalities. A significant number of these fatalities have unknown causes, which shows that a lack of available communication to authorities may have exacerbated the accident and led to the deaths. In addition, many deaths from weather could be avoided if the captain had better knowledge of the upcoming environmental conditions. The greater fatality rate at night may be related to the greater difficulty in locating people who need to be rescued. Smaller vessels tend to have less robust communications systems, which would be more likely to go down in event of emergency, leaving people with no way to communicate the problem to rescuers, especially if the boat sinks. Our product can help solve this by providing a method for communication that is unattached to the boat and able to survive difficult conditions, provide a position so rescur=ers can find the location of the person, and provide weather information, including alerts if hazardous weather is approaching.</th>
