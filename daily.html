            <p>Day 1: We began doing our daily update posts today. However, I was not in class this day, as I was at a school activity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="update">
            <p>Day 2: On this day, I returned. However, I didn't know we needed to do daily updates yet, so I don't have any photos. I worked on analysing our design and finding improvements to be made.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="update">
            <p>Day 3: Stil no photo :(. I have been busy with working on the electronic systems within the cyberdeck, and that was most of what I did this day./p>

            <p>Day 4: I finally learned that we had to start daily updates. Today I continued working on how we should power the cyberdeck, which involved analysing batteries, which are pictured here.</p>

            <p>Day 5: We cotinued working on stuff for the Cyberdeck today. To make our case for it, we considered 3D printing it, as it is easier to do that other processes. Pictured here is a 3D printer that we considered using</p>

            <img src="./images/dail6.jpg" alt="Day 6 image">
            <p>Day 6: Mostly just work on the PDR. Also, the batteries we wanted for the cyberdeck arrived</p>

            <img src="./images/daily7.jpg" alt="Day 7 image">
            <p>Day 7: Today all the batteries we needed to power the computer arrived. These are all needed so it will be able to operate for a consectuive 24 hour period. A lot of work was done on this, as well as the PDR.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="update">
            <p>Day 8: Today was just finishing our Preliminary Design Review, which is a rveiew of all the progress we have made up until this point. Here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11v2epeN5gfi70R9SwSe6Gog71pdwpZSMaVgDr-2vOW0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">is a link</a> to view it. This took up a lot of our time and effort, and it shows everything we have worked on this semester, probbaly better than this website does.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="update">
            <p>Day 9: This class we filmed our video presentation. This was meant to be a short 2 minute introduction to the project to get people interested in it. It is posted on my school's Instagram page, and I think it is very good. I do not have the link, however.</p>

            <p>Day 10: Today we continued with battery stuff. All the parts we needed are now here, and we decided to attach the batteries together. The result was this, which is being help up by another group member, Marcus. We also did a lot of work concerning the wiring of the system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="update">
            <p>Day 11: This was our first day back from Christmas break, so I did not get too much done this class. The group mostly discussed what we wanted to accomplish over the next couple weeks.</p>

            <p>Today we got our 3D printing and scanning assignment, and I began to work on it. This is an early part of the 3D printing process.</p>
