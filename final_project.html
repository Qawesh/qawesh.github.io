    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Each year, hundreds of vessels go missing in remote areas without access to communication or the internet. This lack of reliable information sources in critical situations can lead to an increase in the risk of loss of life and property due to longer rescue times. With the Boat Cyberdeck, we can solve this problems by providing boaters a source of information and a way to more easily contact rescuers.</p>
    <p>This product exists to help provide greater safety to boaters so they are able to react quickly in cases of emergency with information and access to help. This product is primarily made for them, and the specifics of the product are geared towards use around water, though it could theoretically be used in a variety of situations.</p>
