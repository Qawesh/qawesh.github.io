        <h2>3D Product Design</h2>
        <p>For my group's product, we needed to make a 3D rendering of what we thought the design should have looked like. To do this, I used Onshape, as I have experience with the system and have used it in the past. I quickly retaught myself the important features of it and proceeded to begin I design. I ended up making two identical containers connected by a hinge which would allow it to open and close. On the right are images of the final design and the steps used to make it.</p>

        <div class="caption">To make it less sharp and more visually appealing, the side and outside edges are filleted.</div>
